# Tucunaré
A custom 3D graphics rendering pipeline for JavaScript

Tucunaré is a simple rendering engine designed to render 3D geometry and intended as an academic learning tool.
If you want to render real-time 3D graphics, please use something like WebGL. Tucunaré simply isn't built for speed, and honestly can't be. WebGL has access to the GPU, something a simple library like Tucunaré can't access.
