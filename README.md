# Tucunaré
A custom 3D graphics rendering pipeline for JavaScript

# Disclaimer
Tucunaré is a simple 3D rendering engine intended as an academic learning tool. If you want to render real-time 3D graphics, please use something like [WebGL](https://get.webgl.org/). Tucunaré simply isn't built for speed, and honestly can't be. WebGL has access to the GPU, something a simple library like Tucunaré can't access.


# What does Tucunaré mean?
Tucunaré is the Brazilian name for [Peacock Bass](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peacock_bass), a very colorful fish in the Amazon region. ![image of a peacock bass](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/e/ef/Peacock_bass.jpg)
